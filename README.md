# 🧠 Research AI Agent 

---

## 📌 Outline
Researchers and students face challenges in quickly finding, summarizing, and organizing academic research. Traditional search engines return too much unstructured data, and manual reading of papers is time-consuming.  
Our AI Research Agent solves this by **autonomously searching literature, summarizing key findings, and providing detailed answers with citations**.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Researchers, students, and professionals often struggle to stay updated with the rapidly growing volume of academic publications, technical articles, datasets, and evolving research trends.  
Manually reviewing, filtering, and synthesizing information across multiple domains is time-consuming and inefficient.

**Proposed Solution:**  
An **AI Research Agent** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to assist users in:
- Conducting efficient literature reviews  
- Generating summaries  
- Identifying research gaps  
- Recommending relevant papers, datasets, or collaborators
